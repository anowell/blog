<div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px;">

I am a technical leader focused on developing **high performing** teams and **learning organizations** while maintaining strong technical roots in **distributed system architecture** and **production engineering**. I focus on outcomes and achieving them via processes aligned with [DevOps principles](https://medium.com/ibm-garage/the-modern-devops-manifesto-f06c82964722) and it's roots in [Systems Thinking](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/how-apply-systems-thinking-devops).

But for now, I've turned my focus toward a local, hard-to-scale, face-to-face, challenge.
