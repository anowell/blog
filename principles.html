        <h1>Leadership Principles</h1>
<p>Learning is the tool that enables <b>adapting to change</b>. Execution is the art of <b>building value</b>. Communication is foundational to effective leadership and notably to modeling how we <b>care for people</b>. These principles guide my approach to both technical and organizational leadership.</p>
<div class="ribbon ribbon-orange">
<h2><i class="fa fa-book"></i> Learn</h2>
<p><em>There is no talent shortage; there is a shortage of learning organizations investing in their people.</em></p>
</div>
<h3>Intellectual Curiosity unlocks Intellectual Horsepower</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are artisans that take pride in and pursue mastery of our craft.</li>
<li>Great engineers have an insatiable appetite for learning how and why things work. </li>
<li>First principles matter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Expect Failure; Don't Accept It</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expect and design both systems and processes for failure, but it is essential to learn from and overcome failures.</li>
<li>Post-mortem culture defines the resiliency of both systems and organizations (by extension of Conway's law).</li>
<li>Post-mortems must be transparent, blameless, and result in action.</li>
</ul>
<div class="ribbon ribbon-green">
<h2><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Communicate</h2>
<p><em>All else equal, hire the candidate who writes more effectively; it demonstrates a higher level thought and communication.</em></p>
</div>
<h3>Radical Candor</h3>
<ul>
<li>Say what you mean, but don't mistake candor for &quot;brutal honesty&quot; (an excuse to be cruel).</li>
<li>Be direct, be thoughtful, but know your audience, and be human.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strong Opinions; Weakly Held</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have enough passion to care and enough humility to embrace competing opinions.</li>
<li>Pick your battles judiciously, but be willing to stake your reputation on the battles you do pick.</li>
<li>Weakly held opinions are overturned by better reasoning, not louder voices nor squeaky wheels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Persuade through Listening</h3>
<ul>
<li>Effective communication starts with active listening.</li>
<li>Disagreements usually stem from different context. Persuasion and alignment are most achievable once the contextual differences are clear.</li>
<li>Understand tradeoffs. Do not settle for mediocre compromise. Seek solutions that exist in the creative tension of tradeoffs. </li>
<li>The power to make decisions comes with the requirement to solicit and genuinely consider feedback.</li>
<li>Once a perspective is heard and understood, reiterating it is &quot;squeaky wheel&quot; politicking. Cut it out.</li>
<li>&quot;I was right, but nobody listened to me&quot; means &quot;I failed to persuade anybody.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<div class="ribbon ribbon-blue">
<h2><i class="fa fa-wrench"></i> Execute</h2>
<p><em>Great execution on a mediocre idea is better than mediocre execution of a great idea.</em></p>
</div>
<h3>Empower People; Expect Accountability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Teams have far more aggregate capacity then their leaders; leaders must be multipliers, not &quot;plus ones&quot;.</li>
<li>Empowering people starts with individual competence and organizational clarity.</li>
<li>With greater empowerment comes greater responsibility and accountability.</li>
<li>Leaders give credit and take blame - &quot;buck stops here&quot; mentality.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Move Forward; Expect to Adapt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Perfect solutions are rarely achievable under real-world constraints.</li>
<li>Make constant, incremental progress.</li>
<li>&quot;Fire and Motion&quot;: Move forward with your own mission, or get pinned in by competition.</li>
<li>Focus on challenges that need solved now; leave options for adapting later when context and knowledge increase.</li>
<li>Change is constant. A great solution last year may be entirely inadequate today.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sustainable, High Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Work-life balance is not an enemy of startup or high-performance culture.</li>
<li>Work hard, and play hard. Personal lives affect work performance; proactive personal care is imperative and expected.</li>
<li>We run a marathon; we run it to win, not just for the sake of running it.</li>
<li>Value results, not effort. Reward sustainable delivery of value, not burnout-inducing heroics.</li>
<li>Drive toward outcomes, not merely completion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Win Ethically</h3>
<ul>
<li>Win together: avoid zero-sum thinking with peers and partners.</li>
<li>Compete to win: no competitor should beat us in our mission</li>
<li>Never compromise on ethics. It may be harder to win ethically than to win &quot;at any cost&quot;, but that will neither be a justification for compromising on ethics nor for not winning.</li>
</ul>
