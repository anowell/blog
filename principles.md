# Leadership Principles

Learning is the tool that enables <b>adapting to change</b>. Execution is the art of <b>building value</b>. Communication is foundational to both in addition to modeling how we <b>care for people</b>. These principles guide my approach to both technical and organizational leadership.

<div class="ribbon ribbon-orange">

## <i class="fa fa-book"></i> Learn

_There is no talent shortage; there is a shortage of learning organizations investing in their people._

</div>

### Intellectual Curiosity unlocks Intellectual Horsepower

- We are artisans that take pride in and pursue mastery of our craft.
- Great engineers have an insatiable appetite for learning how and why things work. 
- First principles matter.

### Expect Failure; Don't Accept It

- Expect and design both systems and processes for failure, but it is essential to learn from and overcome failures.
- Post-mortem culture defines the resiliency of both systems and organizations (by extension of Conway's law).
- Post-mortems must be transparent, blameless, and result in action.

## <i class="fa fa-users"></i> Communicate

_All else equal, hire the candidate who writes more effectively; it demonstrates a higher level thought and communication._

</div>

### Radical Candor

- Say what you mean, but don't mistake candor for "brutal honesty" (an excuse to be cruel).
- Be direct, be thoughtful, but know your audience, and be human.

### Strong Opinions; Weakly Held

- Have enough passion to care and enough humility to embrace competing opinions.
- Pick your battles judiciously, but be willing to stake your reputation on the battles you do pick.
- Weakly held opinions are overturned by better reasoning, not louder voices nor squeaky wheels.

### Persuade through Listening

- Effective communication starts with active listening.
- Disagreements usually stem from different context. Persuasion and alignment are most achievable once the contextual differences are clear.
- Understand tradeoffs. Do not settle for mediocre compromise. Seek solutions that exist in the creative tension of tradeoffs. 
- The power to make decisions comes with the requirement to solicit and genuinely consider feedback.
- Once a perspective is heard and understood, reiterating it is "squeaky wheel" politicking. Cut it out.
- "I was right, but nobody listened to me" means "I failed to persuade anybody."

## <i class="fa fa-wrench"></i> Execute

_Great execution on a mediocre idea is better than mediocre execution of a great idea._

</div>

### Empower People; Expect Accountability

- Teams have far more aggregate capacity then their leaders; leaders must be multipliers, not "plus ones".
- Empowering people starts with individual competence and organizational clarity.
- With greater empowerment comes greater responsibility and accountability.
- Leaders give credit and take blame - "buck stops here" mentality.

### Move Forward; Expect to Adapt

- Perfect solutions are rarely achievable under real-world constraints.
- Make constant, incremental progress.
- "Fire and Motion": Move forward with your own mission, or get pinned in by competition.
- Focus on challenges that need solved now; leave options for adapting later when context and knowledge increase.
- Change is constant. A great solution last year may be entirely inadequate today.

### Sustainable, High Performance

- Work-life balance is not an enemy of startup or high-performance culture.
- Work hard, and play hard. Personal lives affect work performance; proactive personal care is imperative and expected.
- We run a marathon; we run it to win, not just for the sake of running it.
- Value results, not effort. Reward sustainable delivery of value, not burnout-inducing heroics.
- Drive toward outcomes, not merely completion.

### Win Ethically

- Win together: avoid zero-sum thinking with peers and partners.
- Compete to win: no competitor should beat us in our mission
- Never compromise on ethics. It may be harder to win ethically than to win "at any cost", but that will neither be a justification for compromising on ethics nor for not winning.
